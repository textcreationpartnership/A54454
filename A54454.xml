            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <hi>THE natural man receiveth not the things of the ſpirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſs unto him; neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. <hi>And all men by nature are the children of wrath, Eph.</hi> 2.3. into which ſtate man is faln through tranſgreſſion, and ſo deeply is entered into the pollution, that there is a ground and root of enmity, which is the degenerated part from God in mankind, which hath darkned the underſtanding, whereby it comes to paſs that the hearts of the people are blinded, and the ſons of men clouded in a night of ignorance, whereby they cannot ſee, diſcern, or underſtand the things of God, nor the Scriptures, which declares of the Kingdom in parables, and holds forth godlineſs in a myſtery.</p>
               <p>And therefore the whole world, with the ſtrength of all their Wiſdom, or heigth and depth of their underſtanding or reaſon,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98384:2"/>
are not able to meaſure the ſtate, condition, and life of the Saints aright; they cannot ſee the life of the holy men of God to judge of it otherwiſe, but to ſay that it is a life of ſinne, as is their own life, in the nature of unrighteouſneſs; and therefore whileſt they go about to meaſure another mans ſtate by that which is their own life, and not the meaſure of God, do wreſt the Scriptures, and pervert the truth, and in that miſerable dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs do call their imaginations, The Writing of the Scriptures, even ſuch as is contrary to Truth, and the Scriptures, and the Spirit of the Lord.</p>
               <p>They ſay, <hi>The juſt man, or the moſt righteous man that is, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ſeven times a day;</hi> and this they call Scripture, whileſt the Scripture onely ſaith, That <hi>the juſt man falleth ſeven times, and riſeth up again, but the wicked</hi> [mark the wicked's falling] <hi>ſhall fall into miſchief,</hi> Prov. 24.16. Now the wicked do ſay here, <hi>That the juſt man falleth ſeven times a day into ſin;</hi> whileſt the Scriptures doth not at all ſay that the juſt man ſinneth, but ſaith, <hi>he falleth ſeven times;</hi> as <hi>Paul,</hi> comparing ſpiritual things with ſpiritual, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.13. <hi>David</hi> ſheweth <hi>Many are the affliction of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but the Lord delivereth him out of all,</hi> Pſal. 34 19.</p>
               <p>Again, they wreſt that Scripture, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.8. who writing of ſundry conditions to inſtruct the weak, and to bring the wicked World to a ſight of their wayes, who were in the ſtate of the Phariſees apt to juſtifie ſelf, ſaith, <hi>If we ſay we have no ſin, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our ſelves, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>DAVID</hi> he fell into tranſgreſſion, unto whom God ſent <hi>Nathan</hi> to ſhew him his ſin by a parable, and <hi>David</hi> repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with all his heart; and he turned to the Lord with all his heart after that he had felt the heavy judgements of God upon him becauſe of his tranſgreſſion; and then <hi>David</hi> ſtood in that which was according to Gods own heart, ſo that God ſaid by his Seed, The work of the Lord ſhould be accompliſhed in them days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> he was a perſecutor, and one that conſented to the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Stephen;</hi> yet <hi>Paul</hi> was called, and God in the fulneſs of time made him a choſen veſſel to his glory: And <hi>Paul</hi> whileſt he was in the work of the Lord, and in the ſence and feeling of the operation and working of the power of the Lord in him, after he came to ſee the Work, he declared the Work; for being once in bondage he could ſpeak of bondage; and coming unto liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he could as well ſpeake of liberty. He once cryed out in a query, ſaying, <hi>Who ſhall a liver me from this Body of death?</hi> and he alſo gives the anſwer in plainneſs, and with a heart lift up to the Lord, ſaith, <hi>I thank God, through Jeſus-Chriſt our Lord,</hi> (and confirms the anſwer to his query with other ſound words, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,) <hi>The Law of the ſpirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus, hath made me free from the Law of ſin and death,</hi> Rom. 8.2.</p>

               <head>Concerning Perfection.</head>
               <p>I <hi>Am the way, the truth,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>and the life;</hi> and all that deny perfection in this life, do deny (in the ſubſtance) the coming of the Son, who is the life, who by the vertue and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the reſurrection, reſtored many unto life; and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> writeth, <hi>Your life is hid with Chriſt in God,</hi> Col. 3.3. which is the perfect life, which all the World cannot rightly judge of, foraſmuch as they are not in Chriſt, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not rightly judge of that perfect life which is hid [mark, is hid from all the World who are in ſin, who cannot ſee] with Chriſt in God; Chriſt hideth no imperfect thing with him in God; the pure Fountain of life, cannot receive the corruptible things of death; but that which is of the pure nature of God who is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, is hid with Chriſt in God; and the life of the Saints is of that nature which dwelleth with God who is perfect, with whom no imperfect or incorruptible thing can dwell.</p>
               <p>Gods Juſtice ſheweth his perfection in righteouſneſs, who never required that in the equality of his Ways, but what could be performed by man, as man in the obedience ſtood in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God, who commanded in righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>And God ſaid unto <hi>Abraham, Walk before me, and be thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> Gen. 17.1, 2. there the Scripture ſheweth the command; and <hi>Abraham</hi> hearkned unto the voice of the Lord, and God bleſſed <hi>Abraham</hi> becauſe he obeyed his voice, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.18. there the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſheweth <hi>Abrahams</hi> faithfulneſs and perfect walking before the Lord: And ſuch as accuſe <hi>Abraham</hi> with tranſgreſſion, let them examine whether they in ſo ſaying are not tranſgreſſors, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>Again, no imperfect man or ſinner ſtanding in the nature of ſin and tranſgreſſion, can walk with God, who is infinitely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; but <hi>Enoch</hi> walked with God, and was not, for God tooke him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.24. which the Scripture alſo ſheweth concerning <hi>Noah,</hi> who was a juſt man, and perfect in his generation, who walked with God; but the blind World whoſe underſtandings
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98384:3"/>
are darkned through ſin and iniquity, they cannot diſcern his generation as he was born of God, which was the ground of his perfect walking before the Lord, Gen. 6.9. And as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſaith, <hi>He that is born of God</hi> (which is the generation of the juſt and perfect) <hi>ſinneth not,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.9. he cannot commit ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is born of God; <hi>And except ye be born again, ye cannot ſee the Kingdom of God,</hi> Joh. 3.3. Neither doth the World ſee <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>'s Vinyard, nor his nakedneſs, nor the covering which was caſt thereon, and therefore they do but imagine his trangreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>Again, God ſaid that <hi>Job</hi> was a <hi>perfect man, and upright before the Lord, one that feared God, and eſchewed evil,</hi> Job 1.8. and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Walkers in iniquity and in ſin, who are blinde and dark in their underſtandings, do accuſe <hi>Job</hi> with evil in his ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Let the day periſh wherein I was born, and the night in which it was ſaid, There is a man-child conceived, &amp;c.</hi> Job 3.3, to 14. and notwithſtanding alſo that, <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>Who is he that hideth counſel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not, things too wonderful for me, which I know not, &amp;c. I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye ſeeth thee, wherefore I abhor my ſelf and repent in duſt and aſhes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet God ſaid unto <hi>Eliphas</hi> the Temanite, and his two Friends, <hi>Ye have not ſpoken of me the thing that is right, as my ſervant Job hath,</hi> Job 42.3, 4, 5, 6, 7. And let all the World goe learn this, <hi>Adam was naked, and he knew not that he was naked,</hi> Geneſis 3.7, 10, 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hezekiah</hi> the Captain of the people of the Lord, after the Word of the Lord by the mouth of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the Prophet, came unto him concerning his death, he prayed unto the Lord, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>I beſeech thee O Lord, remember now how I have walked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee in truth, and with a perfect heart.</hi> And <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again with the Word of the Lord to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> to ſay unto him, <hi>I have heard thy prayer, I have ſeen thy tears, behold I will heal thee,</hi> 2 Kings 20.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. and <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s integrity did ſtand to the end, read ver. 16, 17, 18, 19.</p>
               <p>Furthermore all that deny the coming unto perfection in this life, they deny the coming unto Chriſt in this life, who is perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, who ſaith, <hi>I am the reſurrection and the life;</hi> and all that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98384:4"/>
do witneſs the reſurrection, and that are riſen with Chriſt, as ſaith <hi>Paul, Col.</hi> 3.1. they are riſen in, and unto the life which is perfect, which is not of themſelves, as ſelf-juſtification, or by themſelves, as ſelf-righteous; but in, by, and through Chriſt the light of the World, which is the perfect life, which is the light of men, Joh. 1.4.</p>
               <p>And ſuch alſo as do deny perfection in this life, they do deny in the ſubſtance, the end of Chriſts prayer, who prayed, <hi>I in them,</hi> (who was perfect) <hi>and they in me,</hi> (who was without ſin) <hi>that they might be made perfect in one,</hi> who is the light of the World, the perfect life of men, Joh. 17.23.</p>
               <p>Again, ſuch alſo as deny perfection in this life, they deny the end of the Scriptures, as <hi>Paul</hi> writeth to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.16.17. <hi>All Scripture is given by inſpiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for inſtruction in righteouſneſs, that the man of God may be perfect, may be throughly furniſhed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all good works.</hi>

               <p>Again, ſuch alſo as deny perfection in this life, they deny the end of the Miniſtry of Chriſt, which the Scriptures beareth teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of in the Writings thereof, as it ſaith, <hi>he gave ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, ſome Evangeliſts &amp; ſome Paſtors &amp; Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the Work of the Ministry: Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12.</p>
               <p>And again alſo, all ſuch as deny perfection in this life, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the ſubſtance the promiſe, that is, <hi>He ſhall ſave his people from their ſins, Matth.</hi> 1.21. and the Work of Chriſt, for which cauſe he is <hi>God manifeſt in the fleſh, the myſtery of godlineſſe, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the works of the Devil,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8. and from the ſpirit which giveth teſtimony and aſſurance of the promiſes, and therefore from that which ſanctifieth the heart, and clenſeth the mind from all filthineſs both of fleſh and ſpirit, and which leadeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the perfecting holineſs in the fear of the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1.</p>
               <p>Chriſt in his Doctrine taught his Diſciples what to do, and what ought to be left undone, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.6, 7. and in one Word he ſums up all, ſaying, <hi>Be ye perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect, Matth.</hi> 5.48. And Chriſt was faithful in his Word, and not deceitful in his Declaration, which the blinde World would ſeemingly make him to be, who deny perfection; he ſpake even as he meant, in truth, who is the Truth, who is

the Way, and is equal in his commandments for his ſervants to walk in the Way. And he did not command impoſſibilities, but all that ſtood ſtedfaſt, and now do ſtand in his power, by it they were preſerved from unrighteouſneſs, who in it walked unto the end in uprightneſs, and therein finiſhed their teſtimony for the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> alſo wrote to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> ſaying, <hi>We ſpeak wiſdom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them that are perfect,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. And in that Wiſdom <hi>Paul</hi> and his Brethren preached Chriſt, warning every man, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching every man, that they might preſent every man perfect in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.28. And <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Silvanus,</hi> and <hi>Timotheus,</hi> concerning the Church of the Theſſalonians, did <hi>pray night and day exceedingly that they might ſee their face, and m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ght perfect that which was lacking in their Faith,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3 10. And for this alſo the Apoſtle concerning the Hebrews prayeth, <hi>Now the God of Peace, and through the blood of the everlaſting Covenant, make you perfect in every good word and work, Heb.</hi> 13.20, 21. by which ſaith <hi>Iames,</hi> (make) <hi>by works faith comes to be made perfect, Jam.</hi> 2.22. Furthermore the Apoſtle writing to the Hebrews, ſaith, <hi>Therefore leaving the principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt, let us go on unto perfection, Heb.</hi> 6.1. This alſo <hi>Paul</hi> deſired concerning the Church of the Corinthians, even their perfection. And the Apoſtle writing unto a people which were more grown in the Faith, ſaith in this wiſe, <hi>Ye are come unto Mount Zion, and unto the City of the living God, the heavenly Jeruſalem, and to an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable company of Angels, to the general Aſſembly, and Church of the firſt-born which are written in Heaven; and to God the Judge of all, and to the ſpi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>its of juſt men made perfect: Heb.</hi> 12.22, 23. And this is that which they were come unto then, who were then a people upon the face of the earth, who walked in the way of <hi>Abel,</hi> and in the path of <hi>Enoch,</hi> in which alſo the generation of the juſt walked in all ages, <hi>&amp;</hi> is the ſame now in this age, in which the deſpiſed people called Quakers do walk, which is the onely, perfect, true way of God.</p>
               <p>And foraſmuch as the Saints of old did walk in that only true way as they ſtood in the counſel of God, I do therefore enquire of all the World who are livers in ſin, and can hold forth none other way but that which the deceitful and erroneous people

may walk in, Where doth the Scripture in particular ſay <hi>Abel</hi> was a ſinner? and what was his ſin? and in like manner <hi>Enoch, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Elijah, Eliſha, Samuel, Iob, Iſaiah, Ieremiah, Amos, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiel, Daniel, Shadrach, Meſhech,</hi> and <hi>Abednigo; Hoſea, Habak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kuk, Ioel, Obadiah, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zachariah, Malachi,</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> the Governor of Jeruſalem, and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> the Captain of the Lords people, and <hi>Ezra</hi> the prieſt, and <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and <hi>Nathaniel</hi> the true Iſraelite, in whom Chriſt ſaid there was no guile; and <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt, and <hi>Mark,</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and <hi>Epaphras,</hi> who laboured much, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that many might ſtand perfect and compleat in the will of God; and many more mentioned in the Scriptures, whom after their converſions, and once being rooted and grounded in the Faith, particularly I here inſert not, but by theſe the World may ſee they are out of the true Way, unto whom the holy men were not an example of unrighteouſneſs, neither did <hi>Daniel,</hi> or <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiah,</hi> or <hi>Ezra</hi> plead the infirmities of <hi>David</hi> for the Way of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, to be the way of God; and herein the World in their way in pleading the Saints infirmities for ſin whileſt they are upon Earth, is out of the order of Truth, the example and practice of the holy men of God; and finally, if they live in ſin unto death aſſuredly as the Lord God is righteous, they will receive the wages of ſin, which is death.</p>
               <p>And now let the World ſearch, and ſee if their Way be not the old and rotten way, wherein they walk and worſhip.</p>
               <p>But the remnant of the Lord gathered to his praiſe, do walk and worſhip in the new and living way, Heb. 10 20. and let the World ſearch to find out that Way.</p>
